## What is NeuralSync?
     NeuralSync is a work-in-progress paid resource and tool that integrates conversational AI into the GTA world like never before. It takes a modular approach for each of its features. 
- The SmartPeds module adds conversational AI (achieved through OpenAI) to the world's ambient peds. This allows you to walk up to any ped on the streets.
- The VoiceRecognition module provides voice recognition capabilities to the resource and a speech server that can be locally hosted with ease (unfortunately not through a resource), effectively transcribing in-game player speech into text.
- Upcoming **ERS & FivePD** integrations to ship a **custom API** to addon developers of each respective platform and a plugin to allow **server owners** to **easily integrate** NeuralSync into existing ERS callouts, with limitations though due to potential technical issues.
- We also plan to provide support for more resources as time moves on. Outside collaborators are welcome to contribute to the project in order to add their own resource support as well.

## What does this mean?
     Project NeuralSync is currently under steadfast development. Even though it is open-source, it is **not currently available for download**. It will likely be released in the form of a paid package. 

## When can we have it?
     You may notice a milestone on its repository called "v1 Release" with the due date set to April 15th, 2025. The date is expected to change. There is no **official** release date for NeuralSync.

## Why is it open-source?
     It's tough to argue there isn't already competition for this type of resource. I'm developing it in TypeScript, which is not natively supported by FiveM. This allows me to open-source the project without just leaking the download. Open-sourcing this project will allow outside collaborators to contribute to this project, even while I may not be around to maintain it in the distant future. This protects the resource's long-term sustainability and the price tag it has will only be to support me while I am maintaining it. The set price will reflect that and that reality will not be kept secret on whatever marketplaces it is posted to. Also, you can't just throw this source code into FiveM -- That's not how it works.
