# Installation Steps

**Setting up Speech-To-Text Capabilities:**
1. Go to https://wit.ai/ and create an account
2. Create a New Application (Make Sure to set your visibility to Private and the Recognition Language to whatever you want)
3. Once the Application has been created make sure to go the Management -> Settings tab
4. There you will find the Server Access Token (API Key) which will be used to process all the Voice Recognition requests, copy it.
5. Open KiloVoiceRecognition/BACKEND/speech_server.py in a text editor
6. At the top (line 17) you'll see "api_keys = ["
7. Replace "API_KEY_HERE" with your Wit.ai API Key. (This will enable Speech-To-Text capabilities for the python script.)

# This guide is ONLY FOR UBUNTU, you'll have to find your own way to achieve this if you're not on Ubuntu.

**Setting up and starting the speech server** (Inside KiloVoiceRecognition/BACKEND)
1. On Ubuntu: run `chmod u+x ./setup.sh` and run `chmod u+x ./start.sh` and run `chmod u+x ./uninstall.sh` (Other Operating systems, find your alternative. This basically gives the file permissions to execute.)
2. On Ubuntu: run `./setup.sh` (Enter in your public IPv4 or press ENTER to accept the default)
3. On Ubuntu: run `./start.sh`. Enjoy!
4. On Ubuntu: Install pm2. run `npm install -g npm` (Requires NodeJS)
5. On Ubuntu: Run `pm2 start ./start.sh` to run the script in the background
6. On Ubuntu: Run `pm2 startup` to ensure the script runs on server startup.
7. On Ubuntu: Run `pm2 save` whenever you make changes so it saves to the startup script.

**Connecting ChatGPT** (Inside main resource)
1. Rename config.json.example to config.json
2. Edit and replace "AI_KEY_HERE" with your ChatGPT API key (set it up at https://platform.openai.com/).


# Known Issues & Fixes
- If any .sh file isn't working and you're on ubuntu, install dos2unix (apt install dos2unix) and run dox2unix ./setup.sh (or the SH file with the issue).
- If setup.sh isn't working, try running uninstall.sh and then setup.sh. This can happen if the folder is moved around.
